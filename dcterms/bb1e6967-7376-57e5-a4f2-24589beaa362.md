object: "\"Spatial topic and spatial applicability may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates. Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies. Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names [[TGN](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/index.html)]. Where appropriate, named places or time periods may be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.  Because coverage is so broadly defined, it is preferable to use the more specific subproperties Temporal Coverage and Spatial Coverage.\"@en"
