rdf__object: "\"This interval relation is not included in the 13 basic relationships defined in Allen (1984), but is referred to as 'an important relationship' in Allen and Ferguson (1997). It is the disjoint union of :intervalStarts v :intervalDuring v :intervalFinishes . However, that is outside OWL2 expressivity, so is implemented as an explicit property, with :intervalStarts , :intervalDuring , :intervalFinishes as sub-properties\"@en"
