object: "\"Using xsd:dateTime in this place means that the duration of the interval is implicit: it corresponds to the length of the smallest non-zero element of the date-time literal. However, this rule cannot be used for intervals whose duration is more than one rank smaller than the starting time - e.g. the first minute or second of a day, the first hour of a month, or the first day of a year. In these cases the desired interval cannot be distinguished from the interval corresponding to the next rank up. Because of this essential ambiguity, use of this property is not recommended and it is deprecated.\"@en"
