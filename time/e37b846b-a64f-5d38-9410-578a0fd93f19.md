object: "\"In the original 2006 version of OWL-Time, the TimeZone class, with several properties corresponding to a specific model of time-zones, was defined in a separate namespace \"http://www.w3.org/2006/timezone#\". In the current version a class with same local name is put into the main OWL-Time namespace, removing the dependency on the external namespace. An alignment axiom tzont:TimeZone rdfs:subClassOf time:TimeZone . allows data encoded according to the previous version to be consistent with the updated ontology. \""
