object: "\"IANA maintains a database of timezones. These are well maintained and generally considered authoritative, but individual items are not available at individual URIs, so cannot be used directly in data expressed using OWL-Time.\n\nDBPedia provides a set of resources corresponding to the IANA timezones, with a URI for each (e.g. http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australia/Eucla). The World Clock service also provides a list of time zones with the description of each available as an individual webpage with a convenient individual URI (e.g. https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/acwst). These or other, similar, resources might be used as a value of the time:timeZone property.\""
