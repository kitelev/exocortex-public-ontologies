object: "\"A designated timezone is associated with a geographic region. However, for a particular region the offset from UTC often varies seasonally, and the dates of the changes may vary from year to year. The timezone designation usually changes for the different seasons (e.g. Australian Eastern Standard Time vs. Australian Eastern Daylight Time). Furthermore, the offset for a timezone may change over longer timescales, though its designation might not.  \n\nDetailed guidance about working with time zones is given in http://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/ .\"@en"
