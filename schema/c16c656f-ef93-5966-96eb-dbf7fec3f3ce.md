object: "\"An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing at the most general/abstract level, a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" has a titleEIDR of  \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\". This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls \"edits\". See [[editEIDR]]. Since schema.org types like [[Movie]], [[TVEpisode]], [[TVSeason]], and [[TVSeries]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. \""
