object: "\"Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside [[positiveNotes]]). For symmetry \n\nIn the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions \ntend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find [[negativeNotes]] used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, [[negativeNotes]] can be used on [[Product]].\n\nThe property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).\""
