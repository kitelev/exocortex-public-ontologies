object: "\"Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of [[ProductModel]], this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can apply to any [[Product]] included in the group.\""
