rdf__object: '"Spatial topic and spatial applicability may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates. Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies. Recommended practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names [[TGN](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/index.html)]. Where appropriate, named places or time periods may be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges."@en'
