object: "\"This class is optional and not all catalogs will use it. It exists for catalogs where a distinction is made between metadata about a dataset or data service and metadata about the entry for the dataset or data service in the catalog. For example, the publication date property of the dataset reflects the date when the information was originally made available by the publishing agency, while the publication date of the catalog record is the date when the dataset was added to the catalog. In cases where both dates differ, or where only the latter is known, the publication date should only be specified for the catalog record. Notice that the W3C PROV Ontology allows describing further provenance information such as the details of the process and the agent involved in a particular change to a dataset.\"@en"
