This class carries properties common to all catalogued resources, including datasets and data services. It is strongly recommended to use a more specific sub-class. When describing a resource which is not a dcat:Dataset or dcat:DataService, it is recommended to create a suitable sub-class of dcat:Resource, or use dcat:Resource with the dct:type property to indicate the specific type.\"@en"
