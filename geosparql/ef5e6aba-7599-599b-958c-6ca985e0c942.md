object: "\"Spatial accuracy is applicable when a Geometry is used to represent a Feature. It is expressed as a distance that indicates the truthfullness of the positions (coordinates) that define the Geometry. In this case accuracy defines a zone surrounding each coordinate within wich the real positions are known to be. The accuracy value defines this zone as a distance from the coordinate(s) in all directions (e.g. a line, a circle or a sphere, depending on spatial dimension).\"@en"
