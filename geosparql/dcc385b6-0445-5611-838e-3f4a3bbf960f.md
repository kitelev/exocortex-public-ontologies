object: "\"A Feature represents a uniquely identifiable phenomenon, for example a river or an apple. While such phenomena (and therefore the Features used to represent them) are bounded, their boundaries may be crisp (e.g., the declared boundaries of a state), vague (e.g., the delineation of a valley versus its neighboring mountains), and change with time (e.g., a storm front). While discrete in nature, Features may be created from continuous observations, such as an isochrone that determines the region that can be reached by ambulance within 5 minutes.\"@en"
